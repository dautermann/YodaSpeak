# YodaSpeak

## The code test:

>Write a simple iOS app that takes input from the user and turns it into how Master Yoda would have said it. Damn right that is.

>Hold on picking up that Natural Language Processing book just yet. For the implementation hit the Yoda Speak API 
>(see [Yoda Speak on mashape](https://market.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak) to get started up quickly).

>Although this is obviously a tiny app, set up its architecture in an extendable manner that you would feel reasonably proud 
>of, instead of a quick dirty implementation. Assume we'll be expanding the app to use multiple different formatters for 
>the output (e.g. [leet speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) or a text­to­speech API) in the near future.

>Manage dependencies and include unit tests as you feel is appropriate. May the words be with you.

One nice bonus I did here was create a UITextView subclass (based off [this public repo](https://github.com/aaron7pm/Swift-UITextView-Placeholder-Example)) that puts in placeholder text
when a text view is empty.
